Checklist before creating the pull request:

- It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. If the feature is substantial or introduces breaking changes without a discussion, the PR might be closed.
- Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.
- Please, don't make changes to `pnpm-lock.yaml` unless you introduce a new test example.
- Run the tests with `pnpm test:ci`.
- If you introduce new functionality, document it. You can run documentation with `pnpm run docs` command.
- Changes in changelog are generated from PR name. Please, make sure that it explains your changes in an understandable manner. Please, prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, or `chore:`.
